### services 

- $scope, $http, $watch, $log

- $ means that it is injectible 

- controller is bound to view and is only rendered when you pull that view. services allow you to init it once and reuse

- singleton: created once and it gets passed around

- reasons to use
  - performance
  - modularity (DRYness)
  - testability, keeps your controller thin

- four methods for providing data to app
  - value
  - factory 
  - service
  - provider
