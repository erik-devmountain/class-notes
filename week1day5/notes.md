Notes - day 5


##Javascript 

- interactivity
- data store
- make requests to back end
- async (queue)

- always declare function as a variable
  ```var name = function() {

  };```

parameters vs. arguments

 - arguments are the things you pass (or give) during invocation
 - parameter is defined in the function

always use ==== since it uses type checking 

anonymous function doesn't have name because its not being used anywhere else 


var sayName = function() {
  //called function expression
}

function sayName {
  //called function declaration
}


variables in function is not available outside of the function 

### Arrays

- mix data types
